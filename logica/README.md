### üíª About the project

<p id='about'>
    This project showcases a collection of C# solutions that tackle various concepts of programming logic and mathematics based on this <a href="/logica/exercicios1-estrutura-sequencial.pdf">pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The implementation utilizes a Calculadora class, which encapsulates methods for different calculations, while an interactive menu allows users to navigate between exercises and perform specific operations. The project was designed to reinforce understanding of basic operations and control flow using loops, conditionals, and exception handling in C#.
