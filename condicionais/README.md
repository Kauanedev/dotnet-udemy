### üíª About the project

<p id='about'> 
    This project demonstrates a series of conditional operations and logic exercises in C#, exploring concepts such as number analysis, game duration calculation, item pricing through a snack bar menu, tax computation, based on this <a href="./exercicios2-estrutura-condicional.pdf">pdf</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The implementation consists of a `Condicionais` class containing various methods that execute specific logical checks or calculations based on user input. An interactive menu, managed through the `ProgramMenu` class, allows users to select and run each exercise, providing a practical way to deepen their understanding of conditionals, loops, and control structures in C#.
